Website now redirects to text version of this page.

Switched encryption from asymmetric (requiring a key) to symmetric (requiring only a password). Decryption now only requires a password provided in my dead-man's-switch email.

Trimmed archive contents from 21G to 6.5G by excluding: config, caches, externally created data. Fully reviewed: password store in pass(1) format, mail archives in maildir.
